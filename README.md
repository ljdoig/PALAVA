# PALAVA
a pathway-inferring VAE modification for single-cell gene expression data

Welcome!
Please start with the poster pdf which will tell you all about the model and explain a little bit about the 1000x1000 simulation. Then take a look at palava_demonstration.html for a more detailed description of the simulation process, and then palava_1000x1000_w_error.html for a larger scale simulation. 

The main code for this model can be found in lib/palava.py. If you would like to run simulations with this model yourself, the Jupyter notebooks were run using Python 3.8.5 and Pytorch 1.10.1
